# Preydator

Track the hunt. Hear the danger. Own your layout.

Preydator is a retail World of Warcraft addon built specifically for Prey Hunts. It gives you clear stage tracking, cinematic Predator-style audio cues, and a fully customizable progress bar that works with modern Edit Mode workflows.

## Why players use Preydator

- Real-time prey stage tracking using Blizzard quest/widget APIs
- Clean, compact progress bar designed for practical in-combat readability
- Deep visual customization without bloated menus
- Strong audio controls with stage-based sound cues and ambush alerts
- Reliable behavior across custom UI layouts and Edit Mode presets

## Stage flow

1. Scent in the Wind
2. Blood in the Shadows
3. Echoes of the Kill
4. Feast of the Fang

Blizzard does not expose true percentage completion for Prey Hunts. Preydator tracks stage transitions directly, with clear fallback progress display options.
